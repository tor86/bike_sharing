Citi Bike is a known large bike sharing service with a design for quick and convient bike trips around town with a large presence in New York city. Using the data set from the program use in New York city we were to put together a business proposal with bike trip analysis for stakeholders to show if it would be a great investment in Des Moines. Using Tableau to show time spent, breakdown of use by gender, trips during the weekday by hour, trips during the weekday by gender, and user trips by gender by weekday comparing to one time customer and subscribers.

Analysis
--
Most of the users are going to be males who subscribe which would mean that users are going to be residents of NYC vs tourists with most use being during commuter hours. Knowing that we would want to see how the city of Des Moines gets around traditionally as well as amount of males in the population residing in the city when taking into account investing in Des Moines.
